					<h2>Welcome to Inova!</h2>
					<p>Innova is a modern American company situated in Colombus Ohio. Formed in 2018, when friends and colleagues Odion Harb and Abigail Caldwell decided to bring frugal innovation to the local businesses in their home city. Their close and successful partnership with several businesses over those two years resulted in a rapid expansion, and Inova has grown in expertise. While the core philosophy of Inova is still the same, their scope has expanded.</p>

					<p>In an interview with company manager Abigail Caldwell, she stated that: “ Our mission is the same! We want to change people's lives and we can do that through the products and services we help develop, but also in changing the mindset that problems are best left alone and solved by someone else. Problems in our lives provide us with an exciting and wonderful opportunity to come together, cooperate and creatively solve that problem. Everyone can do it! Here at Inova we have a passion for frugal innovation, and we want to share that passion and our expertise with everyone.”

					<h2>What is Frugal Innovation?</h2>
					<p>Innovation is, at its core, creating a solution to a problem. Frugal innovation is creating those solutions with the mindset that they should be affordable, accessible and easily usable by most people, without compromising quality. We at Inova firmly believe that this way of thinking will not only help businesses grow by producing exciting new products and solutions, but also by helping people adapt in their day to day life in an ever changing world.

					<h2>About the Innovation Camps!</h2>
					<p>You don’t think you have it in you to be an innovator? You tell yourself that you are not a creative person? Fear not, we are here to help you! Everyone carries with them unique experiences that shape who they are and their way of viewing the world. This is a very valuable tool in the innovation process, a process that can be learned! Communication, cooperation and critical thinking are some of the skills that form the core pillars of innovation. These valuable skills can be taught and learned, giving you a chance to come up with your best and most creative ideas.</p>

					<p>Innovation Camps is our way of giving you those skills. These camps are similar in structure to a workshop, and will require your participation. Each camp is usually around four days long and will focus on a given theme or relevant topic. Because of Covid-19, some of the Innovation camps take advantage of online tools, such as Zoom. Regular camps with physical attendance will follow all safety regulations for the current pandemic. Check out the calendar for upcoming events and camps!
